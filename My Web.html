        <h2>Welcome to the World of Web Development</h2> <!-- Major section -->
           <p>
            Greetings! I am <strong><em>D Light</em></strong><br> a dedicated web developer with extensive experience in the dynamic field of web technologies.<br> Over the years, I have honed my skills in various programming languages and frameworks, including

                <details><summary>JavaScript for interac tivity and dynamic content updates.</summary></details>
            Additionally, I specialize in creating intuitive user interfaces and <br>prioritize responsive design to ensure optimal viewing experiences across devices.
            
        <h3>Back-End Development</h3> <!-- Subsection -->
            
            In the realm of <strong><em>back-end development</em></strong>, I specialize in server-side programming and database management.<br> Leveraging Node.js and Express, I build robust server applications that efficiently handle requests and responses.<br> My proficiency in RESTful APIs facilitates seamless communication between <strong><em>front-end and back-end systems</em></strong>. <br>Furthermore, I adeptly manage both 
            <ul>
               <li>SQL</li>
                <li>NoSQL</li> 
            </ul> 
            Databases employing PostgreSQL and MongoDB to store and <br>retrieve data while ensuring high performance and scalability.
            
        <h2>The Impact of Web Development</h2>
            
            I firmly believe that web development is more than just <strong>coding</strong>;<br> it is about understanding user needs and delivering solutions that enhance their experiences.<br> Accessibility is a priority in my work, and I adhere to WCAG guidelines and <br>inclusive design practices to ensure that all users can navigate and interact with my websites.<br>
            
        <h3>Continuous Learning and Growth</h3>
            <p>
